CV
========================
My curriculum vitae typesetted in LaTeX based on [an elegant model](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).  

About
------------------------
This repository contains my curriculum vitae source files. In order to build my cv from the source, try latex or pdflatex. However, a current PDF can usually be found in the releases section.  

Thanks to [Lothar :green_heart:](https://github.com/Lothar94) for helping me in writing it.
